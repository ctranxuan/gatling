#########
SSEÂ (Server Sent Event)
#########

SSE support is an extension to the HTTP DSL, whose entry point is the ``sse(requestName: Expression[String])`` method.

Common operations
=================

.. _http-sse-name:

If you want to deal with several sse per virtual users, you have to give them a name and pass this name on each sse operation:

``sseName(name: String)``

For example::

  sse("SSE Operation").sseName("myCustomName")

Of course, this step is not required if you deal with one single server sent event per virtual user.

.. _http-ws-open:

Get
----

The first thing is to get a server sent event:

``get(url: Expression[String])``

For example::

  .exec(sse("Get SSE").get("/stocks/prices"))


.. _http-sse-close:

Close
-----

When you're done with a server sent event, you can close it:

``close``

For example::

  .exec(sse("Close SSE").close)

Server Messages: Checks
=======================

Dealing with incoming messages from the server is done with checks, passed with the usual ``check()`` method.

Gatling currently only support one check at a time per server sent event.

.. _http-sse-check-set:

Set a Check
-----------

Checks can be set in 2 ways.

First, when sending a message::

  exec(sse("Get SSE").get("/stocks/prices").check(...))


Then, directly from the main HTTP flow::

  exec(sse("Set Check").check(...))

If a check was already registered on the server sent event at this time, it's considered as failed and replaced with the new one.

.. _http-ws-check-build:

Build a Check
-------------

Now, to the matter at heart, how to build a server sent event check. Right now, the checks for the server sent event  are the ones
of the web socket. So, please refer to the websocket section :ref:`Build a Check <http-ws-check-build>` for more details.

Here are few examples::

  exec(sse("sse").get("/stocks/prices")
          .check(wsAwait.within(10).until(1).regex(""""event":"snapshot(.*)"""")))

  exec(sse("sse").get("/stocks/prices")
                     .check(wsListen.within(30 seconds).expect(1))


Configuration
=============

Server sent event support uses the same parameter as the HttpProtocol:

``baseURL(url: String)``: serves as root that will be prepended to all relative server sent event urls

``baseURLs(urls: String*)``: serves as round-robin roots that will be prepended to all relative server sent event urls

**Important:** you need to set the request timeout of the gatling http client to -1 to make it work with the server sent event feature::

  http {
    ...
        ahc {
          requestTimeout = -1                     # Timeout of the requests
          ...
        }
  }

Example
=======

Here's an example that runs against a stock market sample::

  val httpConf = http
    .baseURL("http://localhost:8080/app")
    .header("Accept", "text/event-stream")

  val scn = scenario("Server Sent Event")
    .exec(sse("Stocks").get("/stocks/prices"))
        .check(wsAwait.within(10).until(1).regex(""""event":"snapshot(.*)"""")))
        .pause(15)
        .exec(sse("Close SSE").close())
